# Static & Relative - Rendering System

### Reminders

* If relative is applied, the rendering system renders blocks as static then decides the relative position.

* If static blocks and relative blocks are together, relative blocks always over static blocks

* Relative blocks doesn't affect to width or height of parent element because the rendering system renders blocks as static first then decides the relative position.
